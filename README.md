## Reinforcement Learning in Cart Pole Environment

This Jupyter notebook is designed to explore reinforcement learning techniques using the Cart Pole environment from OpenAI Gym. The main objective is to train a deep Q-network (DQN) to balance a pole on a cart by applying forces to the left or right.

Please see the report for details on experimentations.

### Structure of the Notebook
1. **Utility Functions Import**
2. **Parameter Configuration**: Sets up various configurations for the DQN model such as learning rate, buffer size, batch size, ...
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Runs multiple training simulations with both unoptimized and optimized parameters to compare performance.
4. **Results Visualization**: Visualizes training results using matplotlib to show how the agent's performance improves over time.
